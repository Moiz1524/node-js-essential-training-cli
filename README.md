### Node.js Essential Training

This repository contains my code practice and notes from the Node.js Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning. The course covered essential concepts of Node.js from a command-line interface (CLI) perspective. The repository is organized into the following folders:

## Node Globals

The Node Globals folder contains code examples and notes related to the global objects and variables available in Node.js. It covers topics such as global, process, console, and more. The code snippets demonstrate how to utilize these global resources in Node.js applications.

## Node Modules

The Node Modules folder includes code examples and notes on working with Node.js modules. It explores both built-in modules. The code demonstrates how to import and use modules, as well as how to create and publish your own modules.

## Files and Directories

The Files and Directories folder contains code examples and notes on interacting with files and directories in Node.js. It covers topics such as reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, and navigating the file system. Please note that the paths mentioned in the code may need to be adjusted based on the current file structure.

## File Streams

The File Streams folder explores the concept of streams in Node.js for handling data in a streaming fashion. It covers both readable and writable streams, and demonstrates how to read from and write to files using streams. The code snippets showcase various stream operations and techniques.

Please feel free to explore the code and accompanying notes. Note that if you have moved the files and folders within this repository, you may need to adjust the relative and absolute file paths mentioned in the code accordingly.

Happy Coding!
